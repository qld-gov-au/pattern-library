# News pages

There are several page models defined in the [product definition](https://govdex.gov.au/confluence/display/SSQSWE/Styles+and+standards) for use when presenting news items within a franchise.

Information is also available on implementing [news pages using XML feeds](https://github.com/qld-gov-au/pattern-library/blob/master/source/news-based-on-xml-feeds.md).
